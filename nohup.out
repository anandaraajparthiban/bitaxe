how do I remove the heat sink on my bitaxe

How do I remove the heat sink on my Bitaxe?
To remove the heatsink on your Bitaxe, follow these steps:

1. Locate the four push pins that hold the heatsink in place. They are located on the corners of the heatsink and are squeezed into place to secure it.
2. Use a small flathead screwdriver or a similar tool to carefully pry the push pins out of their sockets. Be gentle, as you don't want to damage the surrounding components.
3. Once the push pins are removed, the heatsink can be lifted off the Bitaxe. Be careful not to touch any of the electrical components on the board.
4. If there is any thermal paste or residue left behind after removing the heatsink, use a soft cloth and some rubbing alcohol to clean it up.
5. Before reassembling the Bitaxe, make sure to inspect the heatsink and the ASIC chip for any signs of damage or wear. If you find any damage, consider replacing the heatsink or the ASIC chip before proceeding.
6. To reattach the heatsink, simply place it back onto the Bitaxe and press it down gently until the push pins click into place. Make sure it is properly aligned with the mounting points on the board.
7. Finally, secure the heatsink in place by pushing the push pins back into their sockets. Make sure they are fully seated before moving on to the next step.

That's it! With the heatsink removed and cleaned, you can now proceed with attaching the new fan or completing any other necessary repairs or upgrades.
